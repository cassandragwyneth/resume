		<p>Fashion is, besides being an extension if personaluty,
		or a mood or a way of expressing inner creativity,
		it’s also a kind of mask, fashion provides a sort of transformative quality, 
		the effect that an item of clothing can have on the way people see you and
		the way you might see yourself is inherently profound. There’s something
		about feeling your best that brings out a confidence in you that you didn’t realize you had.</p>

		<p>Fashion is defined as "a popular trend, especially in styles of dress and
		ornament or manners of behavior," but there is so much more to it than what
		the definition explains. The items of clothing we chose to wear are often times
		our most powerful and apparent forms of personal expression. What we choose to
		wear tells everyone what type of person we are and what we think of ourselves.

			<h1><b>Fashionista by Heart</b></h1>
			<p id="it">Vol. 1 Issue 21</p>
			<p>I am a woman breed by fashion. Fashion has not only empowered me to
			be strong woman i am today but it’s the only matter drives me to excel. 
			Fashion does not just exist, it lives. How you dress can interpret how
			a person feels, how their day went, or what lifestyle they live. I’ve always
			wanted to help women enhance their natural beauty. I suffered from low esteem myself,
			but embracing who i was and my style bought confidence and drive to my life. This has 
			been my passion since i was five years old and ever in the present day fashion is my 
			biggest muse in life. Though i had my obstacles staying true to my style,
			dedication to be successful, and my learning from my mistakes has gotten me to this opportunity today.</p>
